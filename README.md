# HackerEarth solutions

My personal solutions to problems presented on HackerEarth in C/C++.
I try to keep everything self-contained and commented so it is easy for people to understand how my solutions work.
The goal of this repository is both to practice solving intricate problems myself and to help others who are stuck.

## ToDo

+ Clean up some solutions.
+ Keep solving problems.
